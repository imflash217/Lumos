# Python

* `Python` is a **Dynamically Typed** as well as **Strongly Typed** Language.

* `Dynamically Typed` : *Type* tracking is done automatically instead of manually typing the object types (like in `C++`)

* `Strongly Typed` : An object of a particular *type* can only do operations linked to that type (a *string* can only perform string-operations not *list*-operations)

* `Modules` are just packages of additional tools that we `import` to use.

* `strings` are sequences of one-character strings.

* Other more general sequence types include: `lists` and `tuples`.

* In Python, we can also index backwards from end. Positive indexes counts from the left while Negative indexes counts backwards from the right.

* **Immutable Objects** : `numbers`, `strings`, `tuples`

* **Mutable Objects** : `lists`, `dictionaries`, `sets`.

### Numeric Literals:

* In **Python 2.X** :
	* Two `integer` types : 
		* `normal`	: 32 bits
		* `long`	: unlimited precison
	* Python automatically converts up to `long` integer type when extra precision is needed

* In **Python 3.X** : 
	* Only 1 `integer` type: unlimited precision

* `is` operator tests object identity (i.e. address in memory)

* `lambda` creates un-named functions.

yield x 	# Generator function send protocol
lambda args : expression 	# Anonymous function generation
