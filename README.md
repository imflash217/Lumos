# Python

* `Python` is a **Dynamically Typed** as well as **Strongly Typed** Language.

* `Dynamically Typed` : *Type* tracking is done automatically instead of manually typing the object types (like in `C++`)

* `Strongly Typed` : An object of a particular *type* can only do operations linked to that type (a *string* can only perform string-operations not *list*-operations)

* `Modules` are just packages of additional tools that we `import` to use.

* `strings` are sequences of one-character strings.

* Other more general sequence types include: `lists` and `tuples`.

* In Python, we can also index backwards from end. Positive indexes counts from the left while Negative indexes counts backwards from the right.

* **Immutable Objects** : `numbers`, `strings`, `tuples`

* **Mutable Objects** : `lists`, `dictionaries`, `sets`.
